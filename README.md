## Project Overview
This repository contains my coursework project on **leaf classification** using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and other classification methods. The goal was to analyze morphological features of tree leaves (from the provided dataset) and apply dimensionality reduction (PCA) followed by classification techniques.

### Key Steps
1. **Dataset**: Used the `Leaf Images` dataset with descriptor variables (PDF documentation provided).  
2. **Preprocessing**: Cleaned data, normalized features, and explored correlations.  
3. **Dimensionality Reduction**: Applied **PCA** to reduce feature space while preserving variance.  
4. **Classification**: Tested methods like logistic regression (for binary tasks) and others aligned with course material.  
5. **Validation**: Evaluated model performance using accuracy/precision metrics.


## Methods Applied
- **PCA** for feature reduction and visualization.  
- **Logistic Regression** (binary classification).  
- *(Optional: Add other methods you used, e.g., k-NN, Decision Trees)*  

## Results
- Achieved **X% accuracy** in classifying leaf species. *(Replace with your result)*  
- PCA reduced dimensions from **N to M** while retaining **Y%** variance.  

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone the repo:
```bash
   git clone [your-repo-url]
```
2. Run the jupyter notebook:
```bash
    jupyter notebook Leaf_Classification_ACP.ipynb
```
